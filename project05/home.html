<div> <p>Music has always been a tool of expressing emotions, and also a marker of time and the events that have transpired. When we look at the 20th century for music, we often think of two clear periods, rock and roll in the 1970s and the indie grunge revival of the 1990s. Today’s generation, while tech natives, look to the music of the past as a source of inspiration and meaning. Artists like Fleetwood Mac, Janis Joplin, Aerosmith, and The Rolling Stones have enshrined the culture of the time into a transcendent discography of music.

But what really fueled this generation of music? In the ‘50s, Elvis Presley lit “the fuse for the rock & roll explosion” and the ‘60s saw rock develop into a counter-culture movement by Bob Dylan, and The Beatles, but the ‘70s emplaced a “philosophical treatise on rock” where rock became “self-aware of its own virtues and flaws.” Rock became even more complex, and multi-layered encapsulating the political turmoil and social struggles, its rebellious nature resonating with youth. The mysticism of the era brought about festivals like Woodstock and left a dreamy imprint on time.

    <div><p>Rock itself originated from an integration of electric guitars, and drumbeats with blues and country music. Rockstars were not just musicians, but performers that lit up their audience “rock’s aggressive attack suggested a sexual freedom that was shocking during that conservative age.” As rock overtook mainstream music, bands developed their own niche sounds like Pink Floyd incorporating psychedelic sounds and Led Zeppelin shaping hard rock with their heavier tones. Rock has enchanted us all, because of the feeling it can bring out and represent, the stars of the time represented a unique fashion, energy, and romanticism we still seek out today.  </p></div>
