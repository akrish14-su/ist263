                ROMANTICIZING ROCK:  

While people tend to romanticize the past, whether it be because it was the peak of their youth or because it represents something they wish they were able to experience, we often look at the past with rose-tinted glasses. While it can be easy to listen to music of the time, and the whimsical fashion of the 70s the rockstars of the time dealt with substance abuse, and while fascination with this rebellious counterculture is understandable – it is hard to look past the glamorization of addiction. The romanticization of drugs as a form of rebellion is harmful, and dangerous to young generations. Looking back at Woodstock, and rock music performances is fascinating, and enthralling but those images and videos do not showcase the debilitating pain, mental health issues, and suffering faced by many of those people. It is important to separate the meaning of music from its co-existing culture which it's enthralled in.12 

WHY ROCK?  

Throughout, we have touched on rocks transformative, emotionally evocative nature – can we truly describe why rock music has touched so many hearts and lived beyond the tribulations of time. Rock music is soulful, an “experience that touches the very core of our existence and literally rocks our souls” and as listeners we are swept away by this feeling.13 The themes present in rock music incite questions on the human condition, it makes us question our purpose, our spirituality, and the circumstances we find ourselves in. It speaks about love, heartbreak, feelings that seem seldom to you but are felt by many. Being a part of rock music, whether hearing it live, or being a fan of a band seems like an ethereal connection that is truly beyond the ordinary.
