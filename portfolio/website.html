    <p class="aboutme"> The story I am interested in mapping is the interweaving of two core ideas, how can we map love and connection and how we as humans define humanity – all-encompassing the importance of in-person connection in a digitized world. Since each week we are tackling different expressionistic lenses of mapping, I want to explore a multitude of smaller subsets that are representative of “Love” and “Connection”. <br><br>

        My story is spatial because I will be exploring love in location and hyper-specific data to tell a story. For example, this week I will look at the places in the world where people feel most connected to one another, and which countries say “I love you” the most (both datasets I have found). Regarding the hyper-specific data, as I mentioned I want to look at different angles of connection like eye contact, expressions of love: audio, writing, love letters, poetry, love languages, love as a driving force for innovation, etc. I have been able to find interesting data on “the look of love” and “prioritizing eye contact in the digital age.” I do think it will be challenging to express the spatial nature of this story through traditional mechanisms, hence I would like to dive deeper into how I can challenge these boundaries whether it be through the use of a physical metaphor to express love or working with mixed media. I also think looking more closely/re-reading Margaret Pearce’s work and the storyboarding behind the body map will help me strengthen my understanding. <br> <br>
        
        My story is important because I feel that we are degrading the importance of humanity and connection in favor of a digitized approach. Love and connection is at the core of the human experience, it is beautiful, dynamic, and painful but it is this complexity and depth of feeling that allows us to innovate beyond boundaries. If we do not cherish and value connection, what do we strive for as humans? I hope through my multi-layered approach I can create a physical depiction of connection so it can serve as a reminder and a driver to seek out community with all those around us.
